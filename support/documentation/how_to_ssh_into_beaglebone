**SSH into BeagleBone**
1. Copy 'ssh_beaglebone.sh' script from Git repo. I put it in my home directory.
2. Edit script variables: USER - account on BeagleBone
						  REPO - path to Git Repo from where this script is
3. Make script executable by typing 'sudo chmod 700 ssh_beaglebone.sh'
4. Plug BeagleBone into power.
5. Wait about a minute for WL LED (beside PWR LED and barrel jack) to stay on.
6. Run scipt: './ssh_beaglebone.sh'
7. Enter 'yes' if prompted to connect to new host.
8. Enter password.
9. You should now be connected.

***Advanced Spell Casting***
**Set a shortcut to run the SSH Scipt**
1. In your home directory, edit your bashrc file: 'vim .bashrc' 
2. At the bottom of the file, add the line
	alias beagle='./ssh_beaglebone.sh'
3. Save and exit.
4. Update bash: 'source .bashrc'
5. Test the shortcut: 'beagle'

**Hiding the Script**
1. I personally hide the script so that I don't see it with ls:
	'mv ssh_beaglebone.sh .ssh_beaglebone.sh'
2. Change any aliases create to include the '.' in the name.

**SSH into BeagleBone Without a Password**
1. If you have not generated an SSH key yet (like for our Git server), do so:
	ssh-keygen
	(For all of the questions asked by ssh-keygen, just press enter)
2. Turn the BeagleBone on and get the IP address from the Git Repo:
	cd IEEE_2019
	git pull
	cat support/ip_address
2. Now copy your public SSH key to the BeagleBone:
	ssh-copy-id	debian@10.10.10.10
	(Debian is the account you want to share the key with)
	(10.10.10.10 is the BeagleBone IP)
3. Your public key should now be shared with the BeagleBone.

The result of combining all of these scripts and shortcuts should be the ability
to plug in the BeagleBone and connect using a single shortcut.
